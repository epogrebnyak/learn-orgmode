** DONE My goals for using Emacs: how can Emacs boost my productivity?

  Using a new productivity tool may actually divert you from solving real problems.
  I admit, I've done this before with other tools.
 
  Reality check - actions that indicate progress in problem-solving:

    - drafting and sending out documents more often
    - collecting feedback
    - assigning tasks to someone 
    - controlling results
    - billing and collecting payments
    - backlog and debt of promises reduce


** Motivation                                                     

Starting points:

 - I'm ok with markdown, rst, pandoc
 - I do work part in console (WSL Ubuntu)
 - I use git/github for saving my work
 - I run a few sites static site generators (Hugo, mkdocs)
 - Have Notepad++ (text encodings), sublime (aesthetics) and VS Code installed 
 - Sympathetic to lisp

Intents:

 - Not a very organised person (my wife has a better Evernote and Google calendar than myself)
 - I like typing and working with cheklists, including Github-style `[x]`
 - Org-mode seems a powerful system for organising work
 
Hate:

 - Just starting Emacs is frustrating - can't do anything, arrh!
 - Finding way out of vim `wq:`
 - Shortcut conflicts


** SOMEDAY About TODOs 

  - text editors: neovim vs emacs
  - text-based todos: org-mode, todo.txt
  - GUI todos: Evernote, Remember-the-Milk 
  - writing a todo app: "classic" programming task 
  - pshychology of self-organisation and procrastination
  - delegate and say no

 It is important to state what is outside of scope of project -
 to save time and mental energy. Topics I try to avoid now:

 - git in emacs, magit
 - сheck е-mail
 - edit config extensively
 - learn lisp 
 - vim, neovim, Emacs Evil mode
 - ergomode and fancy configs
 - Emacs derivatives (spacemacs, doom)
 - GUI mode on Windows WSL
