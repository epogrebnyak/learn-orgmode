* About this file

- I add new things I learn about Emacs and orgmode here.
- I formulate questions about where I stumbled, marked :WIP:


* Starting Emacs
** Minimal pipeline

 - Install emacs on WSL with =sudo apt-get install emacs= 
 - Launch emacs with =emacs= command
 - Open a file with F10 menu
 - Edit file using orgmode
 - Save file *C-x C-s*
 - Exit Emacs *C-x C-c*

:INSTALL: 
  
 - Running in cmder bash (ubuntu)
 - Windows Emacs MSI (bad russian font spacing)
 - VSCode extension (no agenda view)

:END:

** Improvements

  - F10 may need Fnlock to work on Lenovo - use Fn-Esc.
  - Configure terminal to resolve [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/68105/how-to-use-ctrl-c-on-wsl-key-binding-conflict][key binding conflicts]] like Ctrl-C. See also =org-disputed-keys= in [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Conflicts.html][Orgmode conflicts]].
  - Launch emacs with filename =emacs -nw README.org=
  - Use Shift for selection and CUA mode with more familiar key bindings. 
  - =pandoc README.org -f org -t gfm -o README.md= (see pandoc [[https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#general-options][formats list]])

** Learning in progress :WIP: 
*** Attempting X410 video system :WIP:

 - https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/23/using-emacs-on-windows-with-wsl2/
 - starts with two windows, must disable the tutorial window 
 - TODO: must buy from Windows store

** Emacs configuration
*** Where is the config?

    - ~/.emacs is a file 
    - ~/.emacs.d is a directory
    - Q: what is th difference? 

*** Setting org-support-shift-select and CUA options
  - Selecting with Shift is already built-in part of Emacs, but not org-mode
  - Start with 'M-x customize' to find options
  - Setting CUA is part of F10 menu

* Using orgmode
** <TAB> is all you need

- TAB shows/hides headers (quite powerful!)
- Shift-TAB opens all headers 

** Getting around headers

- Alt + left rightor  changes header level
- Alt + up or down moves lines around
- Shift - arrow: 
  - changes list numbering style
  - cycles TODO-DONE in header
  - selects in CUA mode

** Create a hyperlink

 Use =[[url][]]= syntax or C-c C-l
 TODO: hyperlinks inside documents.

** Use timestamps

 SCHEDULED: <2021-08-15 Sun>

 As [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Creating-Timestamps.html#Creating-Timestamps][guide]] suggests:

   - C-c . for timestamp
   - S-arrow for change
   - QUESTION: How to put a timestamp with time, not just date?

** Checkboxes

   - You must type [0/0] or [0%] for checkbox
   - Only X counts for completion, not `x` or `+`
   - C-c C-c toggles and recalculates
   - QUESTION: what can recalcultae on its own?
   - Check Rainer König video  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvgfmED8RD4&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&index=5&t=444s][OrgMode E01S05: Checklists]]

   Sample checkbox list [2/3], [66%]:

     - [X] Item 1
     - [X] Item 2
     - [ ] Item 3
       
** Agenda

    - Use F10 and menu
    - C-a key binding must be configured

**** Question :QUESTION:

    - How to close agenda buffer
** Make a selection, copy and paste selection 
** Other tasks
   - Sort this list based on completion is C-c ^
   - Add more cycling todo tags =#+SEQ_TODO:= 
   - Archive tasks with menu
   - Defintion list with =::= separator

* Remaining questions :WIP:
*** Wanted [0/2]
   Specific:
   - [ ] Move line across headers, beyond own section (Alt - arrow has limits within a header)    
   - [ ] What does bottom line with =-UUU(DOS)**--F1= mean? What is it called? How to remove it?

   General:
   - [ ] How does find and replace work?
   - [ ] Good workflow samples, file samples to learn from 
  
*** Not critical [0/5]
   - [ ] Recalulcate list stats (I double click C-c C-c now to toggle and recalculate)
   - [ ] Add timestamp with current time, not just date 
   - [ ] Change selection color to lightblue (I did, but it did not save)
   - [ ] View calendar
   - [ ] [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/169/how-do-i-reload-a-file-in-a-buffer?newreg=a3feb7dd0515464f962f420449b8f1a5][Reload on file change]] (will allow editing in VS Code)

*** Not todo

   - Editing configuration or using elisp
   - Use spacemacs or doom 
   - Fix wrong spacing of Russian fonts in Windows MSI Emacs GUI

* Reference
** Concepts

 - buffer :: a screen that represents a file or Emacs own output
 - frame :: ...
 - window :: ...

** Notation

  - * is always a header  
  - drawer box has :NAME: and :END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The best advice I've heard for using org-mode in some sort of GTD system 
was not to try and set up categories when you start. 
Start with just a bunch of TODOs, and slowly grow the system as you feel the need to.
